# Proposal for Android App: PhotoShare

## Introduction

PhotoShare is an innovative application that will enable users to share their photos in albums, auto
sync like Google Photos, and allow other users to discover them through an intuitive surfable
interface. The app will be designed with a focus on simplicity, ease of use, and user privacy.

## Features

### User Authentication and Registration

The application will require authentication for users to access the platform. Users can register
with their email address or social media account (e.g., Facebook, Google) credentials.

### Sharing Photos in Albums

After authentication, users can create albums to which they can upload their photos from their
mobile devices or computers. They can invite family, friends, or the public to join these albums,
and also set each album's privacy settings (public, private or by invite only).

### Auto Sync

All photos uploaded to the albums are automatically synchronized across all devices registered under
each user's account, enabling quick and easy access to their memories anywhere, anytime.

### Discoverability

Users can view and explore photos uploaded by others in the form of a stream of photos similar to
Pinterest. The app will employ machine learning algorithms such as object detection and natural
language processing to make it easier for users to search, discover and browse images efficiently.

## Conclusion

PhotoShare offers a unique tool for sharing your photos in real-time with your friends, family, and
the public. It will provide advanced features such as syncing, privacy, and discoverability built on
a solid foundation of security and reliability. We believe this app will revolutionize the way
people share photos on their mobile devices, and we hope you will consider us for the development of
this project.
